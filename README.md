👋 Hi, I’m @danial-r-inam

👀 I’m interested in the fusion of engineering principles and data science to create innovative solutions. My journey from a process engineer in Pakistan's manufacturing sector to a data scientist and SAP S4/HANA Certified Specialist has given me a unique perspective on how to leverage data for strategic decision-making.

🌱 I’m currently enhancing my skills in advanced predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms, and deepening my expertise in SAP S4/HANA. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of AI to revolutionize industry operations and decision-making processes.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that seek to harness the power of data in manufacturing, ERP systems, and beyond. My ideal collaboration involves projects that not only challenge my analytical skills but also have a meaningful impact, whether it's improving operational efficiency, driving business growth, or contributing to groundbreaking research.

🏆 With a track record of leading successful projects, like developing a machine learning model for property price prediction and integrating maintenance strategies into SAP modules, I bring a proven capability to transform challenges into actionable solutions.
